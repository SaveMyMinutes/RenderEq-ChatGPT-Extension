This Chrome extension lets you copy ChatGPT responses with valid KaTeX syntax, so you can paste them directly into Notion and get perfectly formatted math equations with zero hassle. If you’re a student or anyone learning math heavy subjects using AI tools, you know how painful it is to manually fix or convert every single equation. With this extension, you can convert an entire ChatGPT response into clean Markdown — especially with accurate KaTeX math — with one click. To save you even more time, use this companion app that renders your equations perfectly from the markdown.
